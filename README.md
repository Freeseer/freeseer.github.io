## Freeseer's old website

Freeseer is a free and open source screencasting application.
Its primary purpose is capturing video at conferences.

This repository was for our old documentation hosted on GitHub Pages.
We have switched to Read the Docs: [freeseer.readthedocs.org](http://freeseer.readthedocs.org)
