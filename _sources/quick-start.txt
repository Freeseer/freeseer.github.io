Quick-Start Guide
=================

Freeseer is a free and open source screencasting application, primarily
developed for capturing and streaming computer-aided presentations at conferences.

It's been successfully used to capture presentations, demos, training material,
and other videos. It's capable of handling large conferences with many talks
in various rooms.

With Freeseer, you can record video from external sources such as FireWire and
USB (e.g. webcam or another computer's screen via VGA output [#f1]_).

Freeseer is written in Python, uses Qt4 for its GUI, and Gstreamer for video/audio processing.
And it's based on open standards so it supports royalty free audio and video codecs.

`Read our history <http://fosslc.org/drupal/node/596>`_ to find out why Freeseer
was created.

    $ freeseer record  # Recording UI
    $ freeseer talk    # Talk Editor UI
    $ freeseer config  # Configuration UI

You can view usage with the ``-h`` or ``--help`` option::

    $ freeseer -h         # General usage
    $ freeseer record -h  # Recording usage
    $ freeseer talk -h    # Talk Editor usage
    $ freeseer config -h  # Config usage

.. note::
  If you're going to hack on Freeseer, you'll need to run it from source.
  Go into the ``src/`` directory and run it like::
