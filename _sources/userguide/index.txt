User Guide
==========

Freeseer is an extensible platform with core features, and features added by
plugins. This user guide aims to cover all Freeseer's features offered by the
core applications and the default plugins which are distributed with it.

Our goal is for Freeseer to become so straightforward to use that this user
guide should be seldom referenced, but we're not there yet.

If you ever have to refer to this guide, then please :doc:`let us know
</contact>` how we can improve Freeseer!
