Talk Editor
===========

Talk management is what sets Freeseer apart from other screencast
software and why fosslc.org is able to record numerous events and
talks very quickly.

Using the Talk Editor you can pre-populate a database containing
all the information necessary for an event. Which rooms, time,
Speaker, Title, Description, etc... can be prepopulated in the
database. This database is then used later by the
:ref:`record-tool` to filter metadata to a room and also datafill
the produced video files with this metadata.

Importing talk data from a RSS or CSV file is possible by entering
the URL to the files in the URL bar and clicking Load.

You can "Add" and "Remove" a talk by clicking the appropriate buttons.
Clicking "Clear" will clear the database.
