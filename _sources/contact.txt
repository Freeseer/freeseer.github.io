IRC Clients
^^^^^^^^^^^

You can `join using your browser <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#freeseer>`_
or your favourite IRC client.

If you enjoy working from the terminal, you can try `irssi <http://irssi.org/>`_.
To quickly get started:

::

    $ sudo apt-get install irssi
    $ irssi
    # Then, from irssi's prompt:
    /connect irc.freenode.net
    /nick your-nickname
    /join #freeseer

.. tip::

  - To get someone's attention on IRC, mention their username

    - Some IRC clients (like irssi) support autocompletion via the tab key
  - Some clients support shortcuts, such as ``/j`` for ``/join`` and ``/w`` for ``/who``
  - To block activity messages in a channel:
    ``/ignore -channels #freeseer * JOINS PARTS QUITS NICKS``

    - You can specificy more channels by comma separating them

Channel Bot

You've probably noticed this guy ``[o__o]`` hanging out in `#freeseer`.
He's our friendly channel bot from `BotBot.me <https://botbot.me>`_.

He'll respond to certain queries. Try asking him for help::

He'll gladly fetch GitHub issues for you, just type ``gh#<issue-number>``::

 <You> gh#1
 <[o__o]> Package freeseer for Fedora.: https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/1

He also keeps a **log of our channel**. Read any discussions you missed at

Toll-free Phone Number
----------------------

Call for free at **1-877-253-0617 x27**.
If Andrew (our project leader) isn't available to answer the call,
then you'll be asked to leave a voicemail message.

Google+ Hangouts
----------------

We occasionally use `Google+ Hangouts
<http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/>`_ for Freeseer meetings.

Here's some tips for joining our next video chat:

* Add `Andrew Ross <http://gplus.to/aross>`_ to your G+ circles,
  he leads the discussion and starts the hangout
* Have a webcam ready (not recommended for slow connections)
* Have a headset ready (optional but recommended)

Using the Appropriate Communication Method
------------------------------------------
- Use the **mailing list** to discuss topics that affect the whole Freeseer community.

  - Examples: introducing yourself, showing a draft or final version of your
    project proposal, requesting help on a problem after an unsuccessful
    attempt in the IRC room, progress updates
  - If you're unsure which communication method to use, use the mailing list!
- Use the **IRC channel** to have quick discussions that do not
  require input from the whole community.

  - Examples: need help with a bug, questions about the source code or
    git, general questions about Freeseer
  - Off-topic discussions are allowed, as long as they don't interrupt any
    on-going discussions
- Don't contact us through **Twitter**, **Facebook**, or the **blog**. Those
  services are mainly used to broadcast information to the public, and they are
  not necessarily ran by us (i.e. Freeseer contributors).
- Use the **toll-free phone number** if you need to contact Andrew urgently.
- Use **G+ Hangouts** for Freeseer meetings where we discuss progress updates.
