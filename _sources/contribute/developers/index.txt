=========

Freeseer hopes to be one of the most fun open source projects you could
spend your time hacking on. Our codebase is still fairly small, so you should be
able to get involved quickly.

Freeseer is written in `Python <http://python.org>`_ and uses the `Qt framework
<http://qt.nokia.com/products>`_ for the interface and `GStreamer
<http://www.gstreamer.net>`_ as the multimedia framework.

Note that some of the existing code may not be well documented or may not follow
our coding guidelines and styleguides that we use. If you come across this,
please notify us by opening an issue, or open a Pull Request if you'd like to
fix it.
