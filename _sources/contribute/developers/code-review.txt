Code Review
===========

We do our code reviews on GitHub through `Pull Requests
<https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_.
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub
repository. Once a pull request is sent, we can review the set of changes,
discuss potential modifications, and you can even push follow-up commits if
necessary (without having to close and re-open the pull request).

  - `Merging a pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request>`_

Tips
####

- **Open a Pull Request as early as possible**

  Pull requests are a great way to start a conversation of a feature or a work
  in progress, so send one as soon as possibleâ€”even before you are finished with
  the code. Your team can comment on the feature as it evolves, instead of
  providing all their feedback at the very end.

- **Pull Requests work branch to branch**

  If you have push access to Freeseer/freeseer, you don't need to fork it to work on a new feature.
  Create your topic branch on Freeseer/freeseer instead, then make a pull request in the same repository.

- **A Pull Request doesn't have to be merged**

  Pull requests are easy to make and a great way to get feedback and track progress on a branch.
  But some ideas don't make it. It's *okay* to close a pull request without merging.
