Designer
========

Whether you're a graphical designer, user interface designer, or user experience
designer, we can use your help. Design is becoming increasingly important in
open source projects, yet finding designers to contribute remains challenging.

Good design is hard, so we need your help. Critique our design, show us where we
can improve, and help us make the improvements. Create wireframes, mock-ups,
sketches, and prototypes.

Our goal is to make Freeseer a highly usable app that's simple enough for
a first time user and advanced enough for power users.

Power User
==========

Power users have installed and upgraded Freeseer, know its ins and outs, and
have used it to record several talks. They can help with mailing list and IRC
support, issue tracker management, documentation, and suggestions.
