UI or UX Designer
=================

Design and User Experience have started to play a bigger role in open source software projects.
Getting developers to contribute to open source projects is much easier than getting designers. We want to change that, we think designers deserve some love too.

We know UI and UX are hard (something many developers don't like to admit), and we need your help. Critique our design, show us where we can improve, or improve it for us. If you're a designer, we're all ears.

Our goal is to make Freeseer a beautiful, usable app, that's simple enough for a first time user and advanced enough for power users.
Help us get there by mocking up screenshots, devising wireframes that improve Freeseer's look and feel and user interface, or creating some beautiful icons.

We recommend `Mockingbird <http://gomockingbird.com>`_ for creating and sharing wireframes easily.
Alternatively, if you prefer to hand draw your mockups, just take a screenshot and show us on the mailing list.
