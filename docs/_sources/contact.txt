  - To get someone's attention on IRC, mention their username

    - Some IRC clients (like irssi) support autocompletion via the tab key
  - Shortcuts exists, such as `/j` for `/join` and `/w` for `/who`

Toll-free Phone Number
----------------------

Call for free at **1-877-253-0617 x27**.
If Andrew (our project leader) isn't available to answer the call, then you'll be asked to leave a voicemail message.

We're thinking of setting up a system that forwards these voicemails to our mailing list. Stay tuned! 


Google+ Hangouts
-----------

We occasionally use `Google+ Hangouts
<http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/>`_ for Freeseer meetings.

Here's some tips for joining our next video chat:

* Add `Andrew Ross <http://gplus.to/aross>`_ to your G+ circles, he leads the
  discussion and starts the hangout
* Have a webcam ready
* Have a headset ready (optional but recommended)


Using the Appropriate Communication Method
------------------------------------------
- Use the **mailing list** to discuss topics that affect the whole Freeseer community.

  - Examples: introducing yourself, showing a draft or final version of your
    project proposal, requesting help on a problem after an unsuccessful
    attempt in the IRC room, progress updates
  - If you're unsure which communication method to use, use the mailing list!
- Use the **IRC channel** to have quick discussions that do not
  require input from the whole community.

  - Examples: need help with a bug, questions about the source code or
    git, general questions about Freeseer
  - Off-topic discussions are allowed, as long as they don't interrupt any
    on-going discussions
- Don't use **Twitter**, **Facebook**, or the **blog** to contact us. Those
  services are mainly used to broadcast information to the public, and they are
  not necessarily ran by us (i.e. Freeseer contributors).
- Use the **toll-free phone number** if you need to contact Andrew urgently.
- Use **G+ Hangouts** for Freeseer meetings where we discuss progress updates.
