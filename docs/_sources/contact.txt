You can also find Freeseer community members on various channels across the web:

Toll-free Phone Number
----------------------

Call for free at **1-877-253-0617 x27**.
If Andrew (our project leader) isn't available to answer the call, then you'll be asked to leave a voicemail message.

We're thinking of setting up a system that forwards these voicemails to our mailing list. Stay tuned! 


G+ Hangouts

*TODO:* We're considering using Google+ Hangouts to host Freeseer meetups. Anyone will be welcome to join. Stay tuned!
