How to Report a Bug or Make a Feature Request
=============================================

FreeSeer is an open source project mostly built by volunteers, who troubleshoot and discuss features
in public community spaces. If you've found a bug or have an idea for a new feature, here's what you can do
to get help or feedback most efficiently.


Step 1: Search
--------------

To avoid duplicate work, search `Freeseer's documentation <http://freeseer.github.com/docs/>`_, 
`mailing list archive <http://box674.bluehost.com/pipermail/freeseer_fosslc.org/>`_ and
`issue tracker <https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues>`_ to make sure your
problem or idea hasn't already been documented, discussed or reported. If it has, follow up on the existing mailing
list thread thread or issue tracker comment thread to discuss further.

If your problem or idea hasn't been addressed before, continue to Step 2.


Step 2: Don't File An Issue
---------------------------

`Freeseer's issue tracker <https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues>`_ is public, but you shouldn't file a new
issue unless the problem or feature request has been discussed with the Freeseer community.
If you file a new issue without discussing, you risk it being closed.

Instead of filing a new issue, discuss the problem/idea with the community first to confirm it is indeed a new issue
and not a known bug, a rejected feature idea or an environmental problem versus an application code bug.
There's also a better chance someone in the community will be able to help with the issue or get excited about your feature.


Step 3: Contact the Community
-----------------------------

Send an email to the `Freeseer mailing list <http://box674.bluehost.com/mailman/listinfo/freeseer_fosslc.org>`_
describing your problem or feature idea. You may also use our `IRC channel <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#freeseer>`_
if you think it's a minor issue, but mailing list is preferred. Be specific.

For bug reports, describe step by step exactly what you did and what went wrong, including application messaging word
for word, as well as what version of Freeseer you are running and what operating system and version of Python you are running.

For feature ideas, describe exactly how you think the new functionality should work, and include mockups and 
screenshots if you can. Sell your idea to the community by clearly explaining its benefits and use cases, and how you plan to 
help make the feature. We only build features which align with :doc:`Freeseer's purpose </intro>`.

You can find templates for bug reports and feature requests, below. They are written in github-flavoured markdown format.

Thanks for helping us make Freeseer a great application, and for respecting the community's time and public spaces!
