Common Git Issues
-----------------

Newcomers to git or distrubuted development may run into git issues frequently.
Git can be a lot more complicated than a version control system like Subversion, so it's easier to shoot yourself in the foot.

Here is a list of common problems our community has ran into, and what you should do to fix them.
If your problem isn't listed, search online to see if your problem has been solved before. If it hasn't, ask someone on our
`IRC Channel <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#freeseer>`_ or
`Mailing List <http://box674.bluehost.com/mailman/listinfo/freeseer_fosslc.org>`_ for help.
Once solved, please add your issue and solution to this list!
