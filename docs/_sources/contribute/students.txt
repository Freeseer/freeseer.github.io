Student
=======

Welcome aboard! We love working with students. We try to recruit the best and
brightest students and have them solve fun and challenging problems.
We've worked with students through Google Summer of Code (GSoC),
Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Projects (UCOSP), and Fedora Summer Coding.

Getting Started

1. TODO

Deciding What To Work On
------------------------

We let students choose their projects. There are no set work hours, we think you work best when you want to work.
As long as you get your work done on time, you'll have nothing to worry about.

First you should get familiar with Freeseer and the community.
:doc:`Introduce yourself on the mailing list</contact>`, tell us what you're experienced in or what you want to learn.

Depending on which program you're participating in, you may have to attend a `sprint <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(software_development)>`_ with your new teammates.

Next, you need to document your ideas. Use this
`project proposal template <https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/blob/development/docs/developer_templates/Project_proposal.odt?raw=true>`_.
You may modify it by adding or removing sections that you think are relevant or irrelevant.
It also includes a timeline to help schedule your work. Decide with your professor and/or project mentor when your end date will be.

We don't expect your proposal to be perfect right away. Don't spend too much time on it. In this case it's better to release early
and release often as opposed to a highly polished proposal on your first try.

When you finish your first draft of your proposal, notify everyone on the mailing list and include a link to where they can view it.
We'll give you feedback so you can make any changes if necessary. Once everything looks fine, your proposal will be approved and you can
start working on your projects!

Because Freeseer is still a relatively young project and has a small codebase,
there is lots of room for improvement. This means that your contributions will
have a huge impact on the future of Freeseer! Due to the small size of our
community, you'll also have a lot of responsibility.


Stay In Touch
-------------

A good analogy is driving to a destination. Imagine a friend is driving and you're the navigator in the passenger seat.
The more updates you give your driver, the sooner and safer you'll get to your destination.
On the other hand, rarely updating your driver with directions can get you easily lost or you may not reach your destination on time.

Same goes with your teammates in a project.
If you update them frequently, they can help you out often and give you feedback on your work so there's less chance of screwing up.
But if no one knows what you're working on or if you're having difficulties, then by the time they find out it may be too late to
make changes or get help.

In addition to being active on the mailing list and IRC, you'll be required to write a few blog posts about your progress.
There's usually one at the beginning, one at the midpoint of the term, and one at the end, but feel free to write more!

You may write your blog posts at `fosslc.org <http://www.fosslc.org>`_ (you'll have to register an account first).
Or, if you prefer, you may use your own blog. Just tell us on the mailing list where we can read your latest blog post.


Expectations
------------

* Be available for others to contact you
* Communicate often: be active on IRC and the mailing list
* Try to be a team player, not just a teammate
* Post updates often, let us know when you completed a feature or if you're having difficulty
* 8-10 hours of work per week


How To Succeed
--------------

* Choose an appropriate project that you can realistically accomplish
* We don't expect you to be qualified, that's the point, you're here to learn

the University of Toronto.
