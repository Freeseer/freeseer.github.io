Technical Writer
================

| We want to make Freeseer accessible to everyone with clear and thorough documentation.
| You're reading the very beginning of that effort, but we've got a lot of work to do.

If you know how to write clear descriptions and tutorials on technical topics, we need your help.


How to Contribute Documentation
-------------------------------

We write documentation in plain text files using a format called
`reStructuredText (RST) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_.
We store the RST source files in `Freeseer's documentation repository
<https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer-docs/>`_.
The HTML pages you are reading right now are generated by a tool called
`Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_.
Sphinx produces the HTML pages from the RST source files.
These HTML pages are stored in `Freeseer's website repository
<http://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer.github.com>`_ and hosted with `GitHub Pages
<https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages>`_.

.. tip::
  To see the RST source of a page, click on the "Show Source" link on the sidebar of the page.

To contribute documentation, fork `Freeseer's documentation repository
<https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer-docs/>`_ and `open a pull request
<https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request>`_ for your changes.

Alternately, edit an existing page without leaving your browser using `GitHub's new "Fork and edit this file"
feature <https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button>`_.

.. seealso::
    
    - `reStructuredText primer <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_ is a good RST reference

    - `reStructuredText online editor <http://rst.ninjs.org/>`_ lets you preview your work live on the web

We want to make contributing documentation as easy as possible.
If you're not comfortable using git or GitHub but want to contribute documentation,
write your documentation elsewhere and then email it to :ref:`Freeseer's mailing list <mailing-list-label>`
for review and inclusion into this documentation.


Where to Contribute Documentation
---------------------------------

Documentation that hasn't been completed yet will have a **TODO** notice.
If you see something that looks wrong or can be simplified, or you have an idea
for a new topic or section, please
`open an issue <https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/new>`_.
