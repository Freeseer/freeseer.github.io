Technical Writer
================

Not only does the Freeseer community want to create a great software platform, we want to make it accessible to everyone
with clear and thorough documentation. You're reading the very beginning of that effort, but we've got
a lot of work to do.

If you're a Freeseer user and know how to write clear descriptions and tutorials on technical topics, we need your help.


How to Contribute Documentation
-------------------------------

We write documentation in plain text files using a format called `reStructuredText (RST) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_.
We store those source files in the `Freeseer documentation repository <https://github.com/Freeseer/docs/>`_.
The HTML pages you are reading right now are generated by a tool called `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_.
Sphinx produces the HTML pages from the RST source files.
The HTML pages are stored in the `Freeseer project page repository <http://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer.github.com>`_.
To see the RST source of a page, click on the "Show Source" link on the sidebar of the page.

We use Sphinx because it allows us to easily create documentation in many different formats if the need arises.
Sphinx is also popular for Python-based projects.

To contribute new documentation, :doc:`fork Freeseer's documentation source code and issue a pull request for your changes
</contribute/developers/devfromsource>`. (*TODO*)

Alternately, edit an existing page without leaving your browser using `GitHub's new "Fork and edit this file"
feature <https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button>`_.

.. seealso::
    
    - `reStructuredText primer <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html>`_ is a good RST reference

    - `reStructuredText online editor <http://rst.ninjs.org/>`_ lets you preview your work live on the web

We want to make contributing documentation as easy as possible.
If you're not comfortable using git but want to contribute documentation, author your pages in `Freeseer's Community
Wiki <https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/wiki>`_ and then email them to ThinkUp community mailing list for review
and inclusion in this documentation.


Where to Contribute Documentation
---------------------------------

Documentation that hasn't been completed yet will have a *TODO* notice. You may write documentation for these parts.

If you have an idea for a new topic or section, :doc:`get in touch </contact>` with your ideas.
