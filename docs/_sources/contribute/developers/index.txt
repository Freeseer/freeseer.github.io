Developer
=========

Welcome, developer! So glad you're here. Freeseer is one of the most fun, new open source projects you could spend
your time hacking on. Our codebase is still fairly small, so you should be able to get involved quickly.
Freeseer is written in the `Python<http://python.org/>`_ and uses the `Qt framework <http://qt.nokia.com/products>`_ for
the interface and `GStreamer <http://www.gstreamer.net/>`_ as the multimedia framework.
We do test-driven development here, as well as document-driven development, so get ready to write your tests and docs first.
