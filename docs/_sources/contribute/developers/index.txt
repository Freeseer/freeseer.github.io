Developer
=========

Welcome, developer! Freeseer hopes to be one of the most fun, new open source projects you could spend
your time hacking on. Our codebase is still fairly small, so you should be able to get involved quickly.

Freeseer is written in `Python <http://python.org>`_ and uses the `Qt framework <http://qt.nokia.com/products>`_ for
the interface and `GStreamer <http://www.gstreamer.net>`_ as the multimedia framework.

We aim for test-driven and document-driven development, so write your tests and docs first.
