==========

At Freeseer, we know that software development isn't just about code. We're looking for writers, designers, power users, 
and user experience experts to collaborate with us to make a world-class platform. All are welcome. 

Where to Start?
---------------

The most frequently-asked question we get from potential contributors is "Where do I begin?"
Our answer is always "What are your skills? What are you most interested in working on?"

Freeseer is just as much about community as it is about code, so if you're brand new, the first step is to get onto the
:doc:`community mailing list </contact>` and introduce yourself. Tell us what your skills are and what you're most
excited about in Freeseer, and how you'd like to help. The community can help point you in the right direction. 

How you can contribute to a great open source project depends on your skillset.
