User Guide
==========

Freeseer is an extensible platform with core features, and features added by plugins. This user guide runs down all the
Freeseer features offered by both the core applications and the default plugins which are distributed with it.

We believe that if an application is well designed, it'll be self-explanatory and no documentation on usage should exist.
Our goal is for Freeseer to become that straightforward to use, but we're not there yet.

If you ever have to refer to this guide, then please :doc:`let us know </contact>` what we can improve in Freeseer's design!
